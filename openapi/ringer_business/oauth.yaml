      summary: Fetch the access token
      description: |-
        To access the IVY API the client needs to be authenticated first. The authentication happens through OAuth 2.0 using the `password` and `client_credentilas` grant flows:
        -- `grant_type` - `password`-- The OAuth2.0 authentication scheme is Grant Type: Resource Owner Password Credentials or Refresh Token With the resource owner password credentials grant type, the user provides their service credentials (username and password) directly to the application, which uses the credentials to obtain an access token from the service. This method is basically the sign in endpoint.
        The attributes passed for fetching the access token will be:
          => grant_type Value: password
          => username
          => password
          => client_id
          => client_secret

        The obtained access token will be valid only for 2 hours. Then the new access_token can be obtained by refresh_token. The attributes passed for fetching the new access_token using refresh_token are:
          => grant_type Value: refresh_token
          => refresh_token
          => client_id
          => client_secret

        ------------
        -- `grant_type` - `client_credentials`-- The OAuth2.0 authentication scheme is Grant Type: Resource Client Credentials. The client application provides the `client_id` and `client_secret` and the user is issued a token. Please note that the refresh token is not issued in the response once the token expires.
